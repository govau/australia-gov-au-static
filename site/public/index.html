						<ul>

	<li>Some states and territories are closing their borders, meaning anyone entering will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.
    Currently, Tasmania, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia have announced they will close their borders.
    Essential services are generally exempt from this requirement but some states require undertakings and/or evidence be provided to prove that entry into the state is essential.
    Please refer to State and Territory Governments for more detailed information, including what is considered an essential service.</li>

	<li>If you're submitting a claim for JobSeeker Payment you can do this online 24/7. Online service capacity is being increased and we encourage you to apply in the period ahead. <a href = "https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/jobseeker-payment">Read More.</a></li>
	<li>School closures (both government and non-government) are a matter of the respective state and territory education authorities. <a href="https://www.dese.gov.au/news/coronavirus-covid-19#schools">Read more</a>.</li>

	<li>All pubs, licensed clubs and hotels (excluding accommodation), places of worship, gyms, indoor sporting venues, cinemas, casinos must be closed. Restaurants and cafes can offer takeaway options.
